My parents travelled with me to the picturesque landscapes of the South of France and the high Alps. The golden sun kissed lavender fields, the azure waters of the Mediterranean and the highest snow covered mountain peaks of Europe seemed to stretch infinitely, capturing my imagination and igniting a lifelong love for the great outdoors.

Days spent hiking along rugged trails, breathing in the clean air and absorbing the breathtaking beauty of nature left a mark on my soul. Every moment felt like a canvas waiting to be painted, an emotion waiting to be captured.

Years later I discovered the art of photography. It was as if all those memories flooded back, urging me to pick up a camera and attempt to freeze those fleeting moments in time. I quickly realised that my passion for the outdoors and my newfound love for photography were destined to intertwine.

With each shutter release I strive to encapsulate the same sense of wonder I experience in the field. Through my lens I aim to share the untamed beauty of landscapes, the play of light and shadow, and. the raw emotions that nature evokes. Every photograph is a testament to the connection between my love for exploration and my passion for photography, bridging the gap between what can be seen and what can be felt.
